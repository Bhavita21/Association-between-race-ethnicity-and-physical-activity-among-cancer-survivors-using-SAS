# Association-between-race-ethnicity-and-physical-activity-among-cancer-survivors-using-SAS


### There are two goals to be achieved with this research. 
### 1)    To examine the association between race/ethnicity and physical activity among cancer survivors, 2021
### 2)    To examine the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and physical activity levels among cancer survivors.
### Hypothesis: There is a significant difference in physical activity levels among cancer survivors across different races/ethnicities and this can be due to SES.

## Data Source 
### This is a cross-sectional study design using the Behavioral Risk factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The data collection year is 2021. The variables are considered from core and optional module of Cancer survivorship

## Exposure and Outcome
### Race/Ethnicity and Leisure physical activity

## Covariates
### Age, Gender, Cancer Types, BMI, Insurance, Income, Education

## Statistical Methods
### The descriptive statistics results in Table 1 include unweighted frequencies and unweighted row percentages. The distributions of the selected covariates were compared between people who did and did the physical activity. Statistical tests included chi-square tests to compare distributions of the levels of the categorical variables. The study used progressive adjustment using multivariable logistic regression to examine the association between race, physical activity, and SES while controlling for other relevant covariates. The covariates of interest in this study include age (categorical), sex, income, education, cancer type, BMI, and insurance. The study used SAS software version 9.4 to conduct statistical analyses. The study determined statistical significance as a p-value of â‰¤ 0.05. 
### Model 1: Crude model.
### Model 2: This model was adjusted for age and sex.
### Model 3: This model was adjusted for BMI and cancer type.
### Model 4: This model was adjusted for Education and income.
### The results of this study may help inform interventions to promote physical activity and improve cancer outcomes among different racial and ethnic groups and different socioeconomic backgrounds.
